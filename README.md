## 🌌 Voyage Instructions

1. 🌠 Clone this repository to your earthly machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/file-converter.git
cd file-converter
```

2. 🚀 Propel the script by specifying the input file's origin and the desired output file's destination:

```bash
python File_Converter.py
```

Example:

```bash
python File_Converter.py /path/to/your/input.pdf /path/to/your/output.csv
```

Replace `/path/to/your/input.pdf` with the cosmic path to your input file and `/path/to/your/output.csv` with the celestial output file path. You can also alter the output format to other astral extensions (e.g., `.docx`, `.xlsx`) based on the input file type.
